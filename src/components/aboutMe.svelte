			Hi! My name is Nicolette, I am the founder of Plus One Content. My mission is to preserve
			life's most special moments by creating content that you want to live inside of. I'm here to
			capture all of the important, intimate behind the scenes moments and details and deliver them
			to you within 24 hours. Whether it's a wedding, a birthday, or even a regular day, my content
			captures the energy of life, so you can look back and relive every detail again.<br /><br
			/>I'm not here to replace your incredible photographer and videographer, they'll handle the
			professional pictures you put on the mantle. I'm here to capture the details and moments
			you're afraid of missing. We can even throw in some TikTok trends and have some fun! Think of
			me as your ultimate bridesmaid.
